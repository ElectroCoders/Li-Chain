# Smart License
### This is a product developed by a team of 4 people for [Everest Hack](https://www.everest-hack.com/), the biggest hackathon in Nepal.

### The main aim of this project is to:
1. Eradicate Corruption by making transactions transparent and immutable.
2. Detect Fraud License.
3. Reduce long and tiresome queues outside the transportation authority.
4. Strong security using Blockchain.

The project can be divided into 5 parts:

- [x] [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) based Block Chain
- [x] Database hosting with [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) - the Distributed Web.
- [x] [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) server implementation in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- [x] Website to register for license
- [x] [Dapp](license_issue_Dapp.apk) to track the records necessary to issue the license and run a smart contract to issue license transparently and immutably.
- [x] [Mobile app](fraud_detector_app.apk) for Traffic police to check if the license is fraud or not.
